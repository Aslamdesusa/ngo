			<p class="et">Marathwada region of Maharashtra still lags behind Human Development Index (HDI) as well as socio-economic status as compare to other parts of Maharashtra. The region consists of 8 districts which are not only drought prone but also atrocity prone areas. Feudalism has still forces socio-economic life of people. Secondary status of women is not only leading to violence against women but also this region become infamous for sex selective abortions. High population of landless and unskilled labours, dalit atrocities, violence against women, negligence to child rights, lack of proper educational opportunities and guidance to children as well as youths, high unemployment rate, drug addiction become the features of the region. Society is trapped into vicious circle of poverty.<br><br>In this context, all 8 districts have very low HDI where Beed and Latur rank 18th and 19th on the scale of 35 districts of Maharashtra. Looking at this scenario, a youth Mr. Vinayak Aglawe along with his like-minded friends initiated Shree Chaitanaya Bahuuddeshiya Sevabhavi Sanstha in 2006 to transform the society and make it better place for community people.<br><br>Chaitanaya, itself means New Inspiration. The organization is working for socio-economic, educational development of landless dalit, tribal, women and children and weaker sections of the society. In last four years it has focused on social problems like child labour system, educational development of deprived children, socio-economic development of women, land rights of landless etc. It has maintained liaison with other voluntary organizations working in the same fields. Also it is member/ part of networks like ‘Nehru yuva Kendra [ a network of NGOs on educational development of children and working for women] MMP mine, minerals & people network working of upliftment of women and child labours in mines, and others.<br><br>Shree Chaitanaya Bahuuddeshiya Sevabhavi Sanstha believes in team work and participatory approach. It makes every effort to involve the common people to whom it serves in its interventions.</p>

						<p>Women are mobilized in the community to make them aware about their situation. After trust building, their SHGs are formed. They have been given various training as well as done awareness on social evils. SHG is used as a tool to reach out to women and subsequently various trainings viz. legal rights, health rights, financial transactions, bank linkages, loan application and repayment are imparted to them. Women animators and leaders are identified and developed during the process.</p>

A proper rapport is maintained with the school administration, teachers and parents. A constant monitoring is done to identify child labours and rehabilitate them.</p>

						<p>Dalit / tribal are very much victim of the social evils. These social groups are with organization since its inception. Land rights are the major issue dealt by the organization and still striving for it. Many dalit families have acquired pasture land and started their livelihood. It has given them confidence to lead the dignified life. There is need to do much more activities with dalit / tribal. Local level leadership building is important for self sustainability. Chaitanaya is endevouring to create local level leadership.</p>
